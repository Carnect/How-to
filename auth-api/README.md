## Introduction
Some of our CARNECT applications are protected and the user needs to be authenticated before he is allowed to use them, this is namely the case for the CARNECT Bridge application. The authentication of CARNECT Bridge users is handled via the CARNECT Authentication API. It is prepared to serve as a single service, where the Client application only needs to authenticate once to gain access to all of our CARNECT APIs and services it has permission to. 

This service is public and can therefore also be used by CARNECTâ€™s Client Partner applications to implement a single-sign-on allowing their users to access Bridge and the Partner's application(s) with the same user login. Once the user is authenticated by the Partner application, the application can also request the authentication of this user for CARNECT Bridge by sending the CARNECT specific login and password via the API. A mapping from the partner login table to the Carnect login table maybe needed. 
The advantage is that the Client Partner user does not have to login to CARNECT Bridge after he has looged in to the Partner's application, but can be directed to Bridge with the Carnect authentication API being called in the background.

The CARNECT Authetication API follows the REST conventions and the JSON Web Token (JWT) approach.

## Requirements
To communicate with our API, one requires *either*:
1. A Programming Language supporting HTTP calls
2. REST Client eg. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)
	
## URLs
Carnect offers a sandboxed environment for testing and integration related purposes and a production-ready live environment. The URLs for the resepective environments are:

Environment | URL
--- | --- 
**Sandbox/Testing** | https://auth.cnx-uat.com
**Live** | https://auth.carhire-solutions.com

## Obtaining Authentication Token
**Important:** To authenticate a user it is required that the user account (login) is *already* created in our systems. 
The creation of users is usually handled by CARNECT, therefore please contact your integration or account manager with the list of users you want to have created. Alternatively we can create an "admin" user for you and then you create your own users via the Authentication API endpoint `/create`. For details on how to create users, please contact us and refer to the [Detailed API Documentation](#detailed-api-documentation)

A created user has to have an **e-Mail** and **password**, but can also have other attributes such as **first name**, **last name** etc. (more to come).  **E-Mail** and **password** are required by the authentication API in order to authenticate the user. 
For an successfully authticated user the API returns a token, else an error message.

*Note*: Make sure that the `Content-Type` header is set to **`application/vnd.api+json`**

#### Obtaining Token Programmatically
**curl**
```shell
curl -X POST "https://auth.cnx-uat.com/auth/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" 
  -d '{"email":"YOUR_EMAIL","password":"YOUR_PASSWORD"}'
```

**C#**
```csharp
using (var client = new HttpClient())
{
	client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://auth.cnx-uat.com");
	var request = new StringContent(
                    "{\"email\":\"YOUR_EMAIL\", \"password\":\"YOUR_PASSWORD\"}",
                    Encoding.UTF8,
                    "application/vnd.api+json");
	var result = await client.PostAsync("/auth/token", request);
	var json = await result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	System.Console.WriteLine(json);
}
```

**NodeJS**
```javascript
const request = require('request');

const options = {
  url: 'https://auth.cnx-uat.com/auth/token',
  json: true,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/vnd.api+json',
  },
  body: {
  	type: "users",
  	attributes: {
		email: 'YOUR_EMAIL',
  		password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
	}
  }
};

request.post(options, (err, request, body) => {
	console.log(body)
});
```

#### Obtaining Token Using Postman
1. Set the type of request to `POST`
2. Type the URL wih the endpoint `/auth/token`
3. Set `Content-Type` to `application/vnd.api+json`
4. Click on `Body` tab and enter the JSON body as shown in 7.
5. Click Send
6. View your response

#### Authentication Success
If the request is succesful you with receive a `HTTP 200` with the following body structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "tokens",
    "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "attributes": {
      "value": "eyhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.bDGPpth8MXIc0-54X-W224ZNtTRaNjq-CF_pj8nDJbyCoB-0tMmqorO_mry2gNg9rpSaOBicazCoj18OO61EbgzZaQszqHGzSgXL5VxzwCtwbGxNUHitqDQeX0yZhY2P8I9uDRwOYA7b0XEJP7lQgwjqHzYD-w2axjoH-rV8vdu_LPy48xu8kZnrYVrxM-p6xdAPh77MhBMkELIT0_PXrqEcXmXgC92MwgmBN1Biw62VPcY5q0yg_OYkTAKRXmQQ_i3AO_nFKbYFlkoiLUbsOr-yQY795QQ5o4dL2xYKQaV5ArXZll7mzhPgViz1Dxj0D53Hx8ptw4enx9EMZog"
    }
  }
}
```

The JWT token is present in the `data.attributes.value` key. One should **save** this token and use it to communicate with our systems for any future requests.

#### Authentication Error
If the request is unsuccessful, one will get a `HTTP 401` with the following body structure:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    "Unauthorized request"
  ]
}
``` 

## Using Authentication Token
The JWT token obtained from the [above step](#obtaining-authentication-token) can be used for the following services:

* CARNECT Authentication API - all endpoints besides `/auths`, `/token` and `/recovery`, which are public and need no token
* CARNECT Booking API
* CARNECT User Management
* CARNECT Bridge


**Important**: Authentication API requires that the `Content-Type` be of the type **`application/vnd.api+json`**

The process remains the same - it needs to be passed in the **Authorization** HTTP header with the **Bearer** scheme:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

*For example*, to obtain the token information, one can use `GET /auth/identity` endpoint of the Authentication API. The response includes a *basic* information about the user for whom the token has been issued:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "users",
    "id": "1d6d382a-1357-4ac9-08fd-4bd4aa3b39a8",
    "attributes": {
      "email": "test@test.com",
      "firstName": "Test",
      "lastName": "User",
      "role": {
        "id": "29018f65-bb80-42fa-9c75-754dca470ba5",
        "name": "default role",
        "scope": [ ]
      },
      "status": "active",
      "language": "en-GB",
      "affiliateId": 729,
      "createdAt": "2017-10-06T13:43:20.579Z",
      "association": {
        "organizationId": "145fd5f8-e396-4c90-a4c6-df0f4d544c9b",
        "groupId": null,
        "shopId": null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using Token Programmatically
**cURL**
```shell
curl -X GET "https://auth.cnx-uat.com/auth/identity" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" 
```

**C#**
```csharp
var token = "YOUR_TOKEN";
using(var client = new HttpClient())
{
	client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://auth.cnx-uat.com");
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
	var result = await client.GetAsync("/auth/identity");
	var json = await result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	System.Console.WriteLine(json);
}
```

**NodeJS**
```javascript
const request = require('request');
const token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';

const options = {
  url: 'https://auth.cnx-uat.com/auth/identity',
  json: true,
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
};

request.get(options, (err, request, body) => {
	console.log(body)
});
```

#### Using Token in REST Client

**Postman:**
1. Set the type of request `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` or `DELETE`
2. Type the URL wih the endpoint
3. Set `Content-Type` for `POST` or `PATCH` requests
4. Set the `Authorization` header
5. Click Send
6. View your response
